    "summary": "One paper introduces a memory-efficient 4-bit quantization method for preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo, enabling scalable training with significantly reduced memory overhead through novel Cholesky factor quantization and error feedback. The second paper presents SubZero, a zeroth-order fine-tuning method for large language models that operates in low-dimensional random subspaces to cut memory costs while maintaining high performance and convergence. The third paper proposes PPCN, a probabilistic calibration framework for vision-language models that enhances few-shot semantic segmentation by modeling multi-modal prototypes with uncertainty, improving adaptability and generalization to novel classes.",

    "summary": "One proposes Hard Preference Sampling (HPS), a novel framework for fully exploring varying informativeness of different dispreferred responses via preference sampling to reject harmful content generation and improve efficiency.  Another one designs a novel Neural-Processes-integrated probabilistic framework for interactive 3D segmentation and uncertainty estimation with only a few user clicks. ",

    "summary": "We propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to improve cooperation among LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human teamwork, CaPo enables agents to collaboratively create and dynamically refine a meta-plan, decomposing tasks into subtasks for efficient execution. Progress-based adjustments eliminate redundancies, enhancing coordination. In separate work, we theoretically prove that FixMatch-alike semi-supervised learning outperforms supervised learning in test accuracy.",
