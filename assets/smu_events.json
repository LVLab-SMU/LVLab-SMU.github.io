    "summary": "One paper introduces a memory-efficient 4-bit quantization method for preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo, enabling scalable training with significantly reduced memory overhead through novel Cholesky factor quantization and error feedback. Another one presents SubZero, a zeroth-order fine-tuning method for LLMs that operates in low-dimensional random subspaces to cut memory costs while maintaining high performance and convergence. The third paper proposes a probabilistic calibration framework for VLMs that enhances few-shot semantic segmentation by modeling multi-modal prototypes with uncertainty, improving adaptability and generalization to novel classes.",

    "summary": "We propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to improve cooperation among LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human teamwork, CaPo enables agents to collaboratively create and dynamically refine a meta-plan, decomposing tasks into subtasks for efficient execution. Progress-based adjustments eliminate redundancies, enhancing coordination. In separate work, we theoretically prove that FixMatch-alike semi-supervised learning outperforms supervised learning in test accuracy.",
